           supplies to get started with your painting with a short explanation.

       <h2>Paints:</h2>


       <p class="paraleft">
            Watercolour come in two forms pans and tubes, both have pros and cons.
       </p>

       <p class="paraleft"> Pans:<br> paint in pans
            comes as rectangular or circular "cakes" that are put into individual pans, then placed into a palette. they are dry to the touch and are activated by adding water with your brush or a spray bottle.<br>

            <img src="full_half pans.jpg" alt="paint pans"><br>

            <br>The advantages of using a pan palette are easier to use when your out on the go and you don't have to worry about leakage.<br> on the other hand being as small as they are, redipping your brush over and over when paint a large piece is rather tedious.<br>

            <br>Tubes:<br> watercolour also comes in small toothpaste like tubes. you use the by sqeezing out a small amount onto your pallet and diluting with water.<br>
        </p>    
            <br><img class="pics" src="tube paints.jpg" alt="watercolour paint tubes"><br>
            

        <p>    
            <br>Some of the pros and cons are; tubes are great for doing large washes of colour and as its not in a dry state, you can use it straight out of the tube, giving you more intense colour.<br>
            when left to dry on your palette, depending on the brand, when reactivated the paint may lose some of its vibrency.<br>

        </p>
        <h2>Brushes:</h2>
        <p class="paraleft">
            There are a veriaty of brushes to choose form, but buying them all before you even know how to use one is a huge waste of money. instead, sticking to one or two and learning how to use it properly is best.<br> For example buy 3 varying sizes of round brushes, and that is enough to geet you started.<br>
