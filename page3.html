        <h1>Paper types</h1>

        <p>
            The quality of your paper is really important when it comes to watercolour painting. If you choose the right surface it can greatly enhance the appearance of your artwork.<br> 
        </p> 
        
        <p class="paraleft">one of the first choices you will encounter when selecting a watercolour paper is choosing a surface type. Generally, watercolour papers are one of three different surface types; Hot Pressed(HP), Cold Pressed(NOT) and Rough.</p>

            <br><img class="pics" src="paper surface-types1.jpg"><br>

        <p class="paraleft">Hot pressed is the smoothest watercolour paper and is great for artists looking to render their subjects in fine detail.<br>
        Cold Pressed paper has a medium textured surface favoured by beginners as it is compatible with a variety of techniques and applications.<br>
        Rough, as suggested by the name, is the most textured watercolour paper. The deep pits in the paper are brilliant if you want to get the most out of the granulation of your watercolour paints.</p><br>

        watercolor paper is measured by how much it weighs per 500 sheets. The heavier the paper, the more it weighs and the more water it will take without buckling. The three standard watercolor paper weights are 90, 140 and 300 pounds.

        90 pound watercolor paper will accept a fair amount of water, but is best used with less water than the average watercolorist uses and cannot survive a lot of “scrubbing” or abrasion of the paper. It is also the least expensive.<br>

        140 pound watercolor paper is probably the most commonly used paper by watercolor painters. It is thicker and can handle quite a bit of water and scrubbing. (140 pound paper has a mid-range price tag as well.)<br>

        300 pound watercolor paper is probably the strongest, heaviest paper you will ever need. This weight of paper is like card stock and needs no stretching. (Stretching is outside the scope of this article, but I'll write a tutorial on that later as well.) Heavy 300 pound paper will dry flat without buckling and can take quite a bit of abuse. Naturally, it is also more expensive.
